The objective of this project is to build a deep-learning model that can accurately classify MRI images as either Normal or Abnormal. The model will be trained on a dataset of labeled MRI images and will learn to identify specific patterns and features associated with Bone Marrow Changes in Lumbar Vertebrae. For Bone Marrow Changes in Lumbar Vertebrae classification, Bone Marrow Changes in Lumbar Vertebrae were divided into two main groups: Normal, and Abnormal, depending on the area that is involved. Each of these classes is subsequently divided into sub-groups. To introduce a transfer learning model that can improve the classification of Bone Marrow Changes in Lumbar Vertebrae.
